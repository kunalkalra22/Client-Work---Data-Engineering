This file contains examples of the tags I created using the Member Data, Transaction Data, Line Item Data, Item attributes master, and discount usage for a nationwide cineplex client in India. 
This Analytics base table, aka, Customer Single View, was instrumental in creating customer segments for targeted Marketing campaigns. Over 100 tags at a customer-level were created which captured customer behaviour and preference at various levels, such as temporal, spatial, monetary range, language & content preference.
After using rule-based engineering to create marketable segments using business logic, further hyper-segments were created by splitting the segments on a few key KPIs, and 10% control group was extracted from each Hyper-segment. This control base, which was excluded from any marketing initiatives, provided us with a benchmark to test the efficacy of our marketing strategy.

This code was written in Qlikview, which was the preferred tool of choice for the client, given their massive data size, and is similar to SQL in terms of coding.
