This file contains examples of the tags I created using the Transaction Data, Line Item Data, and Item attributes master for a nationwide cineplex client in India. 
This Analytics base table, aka, Customer Single View, was instrumental in creating customer segments for targeted Marketing campaigns. Over 100 tags at a customer-level were created which captured customer behaviour and preference at various levels, such as temporal, spatial, monetary range, language & content preference

This code was written in Qlikview, which was used to handle the massive amounts of data that client had, and is similar to SQL in terms of coding.
